_Create a game which has borrowings from a classic game from video game history. You are totally free to creatively
interpret the original as you like. Make a KorGE clone of an existing game classic or invent your own game with some
subtle hints to a classic game._  
Your work will be judged by the following criteria

* **Gameplay**
* “is it fun?”, “how are the controls?”, “how original is the gameplay?”
* **Graphics**
* “how good does it look?”
* **Feel**
* “is the composition of audio, video and user-interaction coherent?”
