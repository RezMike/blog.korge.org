Tobse did a remake of the retro console Mephisto Hit Klack.

This is an old German console. In this game, there is a line that is moving in one of the quadrants until you press the button on that quadrant, then another line starts moving in other quadrant. By pressing the matching button at the right moment you have to create squares on all the quadrants.

* You can play it online here: <https://tobsef.github.io/HitKlack/webstart/index.html>
* And check the source code: <https://github.com/TobseF/HitKlack>
