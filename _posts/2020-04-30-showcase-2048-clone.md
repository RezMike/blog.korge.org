RezMike did a 2048 clone using KorGE.

The game rules are simple: by either using the arrow keys, or by swiping in any direction you have to combine power of two numbers to reach the 2048.

You can play directly in your browser here: <https://rezmike.github.io/2048/>
And you can access the source code here: <https://github.com/RezMike/2048>
